Hello! Blinkk is an independent micro development studio with a
worldwide team, based in San Francisco. We work on big and small projects for
big and small clients.

Our mission is to **streamline website production**.

We specialize in building marketing and informational websites, with a focus on
maintainability, interactivity, accessibility, localization, and performance. We
build open source tools like [Amagaki](https://github.com/blinkk/amagaki),
[Degu](https://github.com/blinkk/degu), and
[Fileset](https://github.com/blinkk/fileset) to help us launch projects
again and again.

Browse our open source projects here on GitHub. You can also find us on [our
